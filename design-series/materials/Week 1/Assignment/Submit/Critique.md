### Viz1 Critiques:

- Color scheme is distracting and seems to have no significance
- Total trend line gives the impression of a timeline when none are represented
- Total trend is being represented differently from the other products for no reason and has different values on it's y axis
- It is difficult to compare the best strategy per product which seems to be the best trend to observe
- It would be better to group the bars by product so that performance across different strategies can be more easily observed

### Viz2 Critiques:

- Visually the chart is very cluttered
- The data is presented with values and percents but no guidence is given as to what either mean
- Small formatting issues like percent values not being lined up properly and percent signs being on second lines creates an image that feels very disorganized
- Certain percentage values have boxes around them and the reason is not apparent, causing more confusion
- The units are not present for the y-axis which completely obscures what is being measured

### Viz3 Critiques:

- Representation gives the impression of totalling 100% and doesn't acknowledge or display the overlap
- Size of 'bar' doesn't reflect size of values
- While the quotes add flavor to the image it isn't immediately apparent why they are there. They also skew the representation of the groups they describe (Baby Boomers could have worked in tech for 30 years and are being set equal to people who have a smartphone)
- Use of too many fonts
